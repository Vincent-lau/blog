We look at three proof techniques and investigate the connections between them.

## Equivalence of proof techniques in proving the *fixpoint* properties

In this blog we look at three techniques that can be used to prove the fixpoint
of a function, namely, Tarski's fixpoint theorem, lfp1 + lfp2 and Scott induction.
We will shall that they are equivalent to each other by working on an example.

## Tarski's fixpoint

Tarski's fixpoint theorem states that for a function \\(f:D\to D\\), where \\(D\\)
is a domain, the *fixpoint* of the function is given by:

\\[
  \mathit{fix}(f) = \bigsqcup_n f^n(\bot)
\\]



## lfp1 + lfp2



## Scott induction
